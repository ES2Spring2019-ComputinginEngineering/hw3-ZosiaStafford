# Run this code in micro:bit mode

# The following is code for a mini-version of the classic game Asteroids for micro:bit.
# Feel free to read over the following functions to understand what they do,
# they should not need any modification.
# Around line 108 you will find the start of the "main script"
# The main script is the code that makes the game work. It is missing two critical
# conditional statements. Please fill them in.
